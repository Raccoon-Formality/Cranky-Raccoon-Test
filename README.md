# Cranky-Raccoon-Test
Platformer for the Panic Playdate that I don't plan on finishing soon.

This game is about moving platforms and collecting trash or something and it has to do with momentum, I don't think I will finish this project any time soon and even if I do I will probably have to rewrite and change a lot.

So, I want this to be free to use for anyone to give a try or try to learn something from it.
