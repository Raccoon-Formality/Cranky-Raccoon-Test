# Cranky-Raccoon-Test
Platformer for the Panic Playdate that I don't plan on finishing soon.

This game is about moving platforms and collecting trash or something and it has to do with momentum, I don't think I will finish this project any time soon and even if I do I will probably have to rewrite and change a lot.

So, I want this to be free to use for anyone to give a try or try to learn something from it.

All I ask in return is 3 things:

1. show me the cool things you make with it.
2. check out SquidGod and the video tutorial I modified to make this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GbUxjE9rRM
3. Three, consider donating to me on ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/raccoonformality

- **includes:**

Folder named Source with the source code for this project.
Also, the folder named ld54.pdx is a compiled build of a game you can try in the simulator or on real hardware.
I originally wanted to make a demo of this game for Ludum Dare 54, which is why it is named ld54.pdx, but plans fell through.

thank you, have a nice day and have fun.
